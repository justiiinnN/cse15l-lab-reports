# Lab Report 4 
--- 
 - In this report, I will be going through the steps in which I took to complete the task. 


 - Part 1: 
    - The first task was to delete the fork of the repository that had been previously cloned. The reason for this is to start fresh. 
       - To delete the repository in the terminal, the command needed to be used is, ***rm -rf lab7***.  
      
 - Part 2: 
    - After deleting the previously forked repository, we will then refork the file to our github account. 
   
 - Part 3: 
    - This step doesn't have a real task but asks to start the timer to test how fast steps 4-9 could be done. 
 
 - Part 4: 
    - The real task begins now. From the temrinal, we will first loggin to our ieng6 account.
