### Part 1 

### Part 2 

### Part 3
In lab week 3, I would say that I learned quite alot. What I had learned was the basics of creating test cases that work to highlight the functionality of methods within code. Previously, I had no prior knowledge as to self testing code due to graders doing that for us students. After the lab, I applied my new knowledge to self test whenever I create code through creating my own hidden test cases and public tests cases all in which to sight bugs in code.
